### **How to Deal with AI for Developers (Agentec AI Approach)**

1.  **Start with Salaam and Explain Requirements**
    *   Greet the AI politely.
    *   **Developer should elaborate the requirements clearly, preferably in steps.**  
        Example:  
        *“We need to generate module details, validate database impact, and save logs. Here are the steps: 1) Show module details, 2) Validate changes, 3) Save logs.”*
    *   Then **ask AI what tools and rules it will use to achieve this task.**  
        Example:  
        *“List the Agentec AI tools and documentation rules you will follow.”*

2.  **If AI Fails**
    *   **Instruct AI to discover the issue, try again, and give you a solution.**  
        Example:  
        *“Discover why the previous attempt failed, retry with corrections, and provide the solution.”*

3.  **Treat AI Like a Smart New Employee**
    *   After each phase, **ask AI to confirm compliance**:  
        *“Are you following Agentec AI tools and docs rules?”*

4.  **AI Executes Quickly, But You Monitor**
    *   **Instruct AI to show the impact step by step before applying changes.**  
        Example:  
        *“Discover, try again, and give me the solution before committing any changes.”*
    *   **You track and monitor everything.** AI is fast, but responsibility stays with you.

5.  **Work in Phases**
    *   **Tell AI to break the work into phases** and save logs after each step.  
        Example:  
        *“Divide the task into phases and store logs for continuity.”*

6.  **If Session Ends**
    *   **Copy and Paste previous communication**
    *   **Instruct AI to review the last communication before resuming.**
        Example:  
        *“Start by reviewing the last communication and confirm the previous state.”*


8.  **Apply Safety Rules**
    *   **Remind AI to enforce safety and compliance checks** before execution.  
        Example:  
        *“Validate all steps against safety and compliance rules before proceeding.”*

9.  **If AI Becomes Confused**
    *   **End the task and restart with clear instructions.**  
        Example:  
        *“Stop current task. Begin again with a clean plan and clear steps.”*
